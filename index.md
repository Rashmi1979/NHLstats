## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Rashmi1979/NHLstats.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:
• explaining what you did in the project and any interesting finding
• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?
• In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo and the usual repo as well!
The URL to this blog post is what you will submit at the project assignment link.




Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Rashmi1979/NHLstats.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

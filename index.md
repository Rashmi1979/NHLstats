## Project 1


We analyzed NHL data in project one, by writing various functions, data table and plots. It was very interesting to write the wrapper function. 


Creating 6 basic functions were easy to write since those were covered in the class, wrapper function was hard. I do not know much about the Ice Hockey game and hence struggled to group the data. Normally we find the groups of data which helps us to find the frequency, density and other graphs. With this data it was hard.

Asking as many as question up front is good idea, rather than starting late and struggling to find the answers. More practice on the plots is required.
